eio_seek -- Repositions the offset of the open file associated with the fd
argument to the argument offset according to the directive whence

  resource eio_seek(mixed fd, int offset, int whence [, int pri = EIO_PRI_DEFAULT [, callable callback = NULL [, mixed data = NULL]]])~

|eio_seek| repositions the offset of the open file associated with stream,
Socket resource, or file descriptor specified by {fd} to the argument {offset}
according to the directive {whence} as follows: EIO_SEEK_SET - Set position
equal to {offset} bytes. EIO_SEEK_CUR - Set position to current location plus
{offset}. EIO_SEEK_END - Set position to end-of-file plus {offset}.

Stream, Socket resource, or numeric file descriptor

Starting point from which data is to be read.

Number of bytes to be read.

The request priority: EIO_PRI_DEFAULT, EIO_PRI_MIN, EIO_PRI_MAX, or NULL. If
NULL passed, {pri} internally is set to EIO_PRI_DEFAULT.

{callback} function is called when the request is done. It should match the
following prototype:

  void callback(mixed $data, int $result[, resource $req]);

{data} is custom data passed to the request.

{result} request-specific result value; basically, the value returned by
corresponding system call.

{req} is optional request resource which can be used with functions like
|eio_get_last_error|

Arbitrary variable passed to {callback}.

|eio_seek| returns request resource on success or FALSE on error.
