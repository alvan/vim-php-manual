strrpos -- Find the position of the last occurrence of a substring in a string

  int strrpos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset])~

Find the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle} in the {haystack}
string.

{haystack} The string to search in.

{needle} If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

{offset} If specified, search will start this number of characters counted
from the beginning of the string. If the value is negative, search will
instead start from that many characters from the end of the string, searching
backwards.

Returns the position where the needle exists relative to the beginnning of the
{haystack} string (independent of search direction or offset). Also note that
string positions start at 0, and not 1.

Returns FALSE if the needle was not found.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {needle} may now be a string of more than one
character. 5.0.0 The {offset} parameter was introduced.

Checking if a needle is in the haystack It is easy to mistake the return
values for "character found at position 0" and "character not found". Here's
how to detect the difference:

<?php >
  $pos = strrpos($mystring, "b");
  if ($pos === false) { // note: three equal signs
      // not found...
  }
?>



Searching with offsets

<?php >
  $foo = "0123456789a123456789b123456789c";
  
  var_dump(strrpos($foo, '7', -5));  // Starts looking backwards five positions
                                     // from the end. Result: int(17)
  
  var_dump(strrpos($foo, '7', 20));  // Starts searching 20 positions into the
                                     // string. Result: int(27)
  
  var_dump(strrpos($foo, '7', 28));  // Result: bool(false)
?>
