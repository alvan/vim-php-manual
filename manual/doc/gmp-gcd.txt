gmp_gcd -- Calculate GCD

  GMP gmp_gcd(GMP a, GMP b)~

Calculate greatest common divisor of {a} and {b}. The result is always
positive even if either of, or both, input operands are negative.

{a} Either a GMP number resource in PHP 5.5 and earlier, a GMP object in PHP
5.6 and later, or a numeric string provided that it is possible to convert the
latter to a number.

{b} Either a GMP number resource in PHP 5.5 and earlier, a GMP object in PHP
5.6 and later, or a numeric string provided that it is possible to convert the
latter to a number.

A positive GMP number that divides into both {a} and {b}.

<?php >
  $gcd = gmp_gcd("12", "21");
  echo gmp_strval($gcd) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:
