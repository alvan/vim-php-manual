socket_get_option -- Gets socket options for the socket

  mixed socket_get_option(resource socket, int level, int optname)~

The |socket_get_option| function retrieves the value for the option specified
by the {optname} parameter for the specified {socket}.

{socket} A valid socket resource created with |socket_create| or
|socket_accept|.

{level} The {level} parameter specifies the protocol level at which the option
resides. For example, to retrieve options at the socket level, a {level}
parameter of SOL_SOCKET would be used. Other levels, such as TCP, can be used
by specifying the protocol number of that level. Protocol numbers can be found
by using the |getprotobyname| function.

{optname} Available Socket Options Option Description Type SO_DEBUG Reports
whether debugging information is being recorded. int SO_BROADCAST Reports
whether transmission of broadcast messages is supported. int SO_REUSEADDR
Reports whether local addresses can be reused. int SO_KEEPALIVE Reports
whether connections are kept active with periodic transmission of messages. If
the connected socket fails to respond to these messages, the connection is
broken and processes writing to that socket are notified with a SIGPIPE
signal. int SO_LINGER Reports whether the {socket} lingers on |socket_close|
if data is present. By default, when the socket is closed, it attempts to send
all unsent data. In the case of a connection-oriented socket, |socket_close|
will wait for its peer to acknowledge the data.

If l_onoff is non-zero and l_linger is zero, all the unsent data will be
discarded and RST (reset) is sent to the peer in the case of a
connection-oriented socket.

On the other hand, if l_onoff is non-zero and l_linger is non-zero,
|socket_close| will block until all the data is sent or the time specified in
l_linger elapses. If the socket is non-blocking, |socket_close| will fail and
return an error.

array. The array will contain two keys: l_onoff and l_linger. SO_OOBINLINE
Reports whether the {socket} leaves out-of-band data inline. int SO_SNDBUF
Reports the size of the send buffer. int SO_RCVBUF Reports the size of the
receive buffer. int SO_ERROR Reports information about error status and clears
it. int (cannot be set by |socket_set_option|) SO_TYPE Reports the {socket}
type (e.g. SOCK_STREAM). int (cannot be set by |socket_set_option|)
SO_DONTROUTE Reports whether outgoing messages bypass the standard routing
facilities. int SO_RCVLOWAT Reports the minimum number of bytes to process for
{socket} input operations. int SO_RCVTIMEO Reports the timeout value for input
operations. array. The array will contain two keys: sec which is the seconds
part on the timeout value and usec which is the microsecond part of the
timeout value. SO_SNDTIMEO Reports the timeout value specifying the amount of
time that an output function blocks because flow control prevents data from
being sent. array. The array will contain two keys: sec which is the seconds
part on the timeout value and usec which is the microsecond part of the
timeout value. SO_SNDLOWAT Reports the minimum number of bytes to process for
{socket} output operations. int TCP_NODELAY Reports whether the Nagle TCP
algorithm is disabled. int MCAST_JOIN_GROUP Joins a multicast group. (added in
PHP 5.4) array with keys "group", specifying a string with an IPv4 or IPv6
multicast address and "interface", specifying either an interface number (type
int) or a string with the interface name, like "eth0". 0 can be specified to
indicate the interface should be selected using routing rules. (can only be
used in |socket_set_option|) MCAST_LEAVE_GROUP Leaves a multicast group.
(added in PHP 5.4) array. See MCAST_JOIN_GROUP for more information. (can only
be used in |socket_set_option|) MCAST_BLOCK_SOURCE Blocks packets arriving
from a specific source to a specific multicast group, which must have been
previously joined. (added in PHP 5.4) array with the same keys as
MCAST_JOIN_GROUP, plus one extra key, source, which maps to a string
specifying an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the source to be blocked. (can only be
used in |socket_set_option|) MCAST_UNBLOCK_SOURCE Unblocks (start receiving
again) packets arriving from a specific source address to a specific multicast
group, which must have been previously joined. (added in PHP 5.4) array with
the same format as MCAST_BLOCK_SOURCE. (can only be used in
|socket_set_option|) MCAST_JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP Receive packets destined to a
specific multicast group whose source address matches a specific value. (added
in PHP 5.4) array with the same format as MCAST_BLOCK_SOURCE. (can only be
used in |socket_set_option|) MCAST_LEAVE_SOURCE_GROUP Stop receiving packets
destined to a specific multicast group whose soure address matches a specific
value. (added in PHP 5.4) array with the same format as MCAST_BLOCK_SOURCE.
(can only be used in |socket_set_option|) IP_MULTICAST_IF The outgoing
interface for IPv4 multicast packets. (added in PHP 5.4) Either int specifying
the interface number or a string with an interface name, like eth0. The value
0 can be used to indicate the routing table is to used in the interface
selection. The function |socket_get_option| returns an interface index. Note
that, unlike the C API, this option does NOT take an IP address. This
eliminates the interface difference between IP_MULTICAST_IF and
IPV6_MULTICAST_IF. IPV6_MULTICAST_IF The outgoing interface for IPv6 multicast
packets. (added in PHP 5.4) The same as IP_MULTICAST_IF. IP_MULTICAST_LOOP The
multicast loopback policy for IPv4 packets, which determines whether multicast
packets sent by this socket also reach receivers in the same host that have
joined the same multicast group on the outgoing interface used by this socket.
This is the case by default. (added in PHP 5.4) int (either 0 or 1). For
|socket_set_option| any value will be accepted and will be converted to a
boolean following the usual PHP rules. IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP Analogous to
IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, but for IPv6. (added in PHP 5.4) int. See
IP_MULTICAST_LOOP. IP_MULTICAST_TTL The time-to-live of outgoing IPv4
multicast packets. This should be a value between 0 (don't leave the
interface) and 255. The default value is 1 (only the local network is
reached). (added in PHP 5.4) int between 0 and 255. IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS
Analogous to IP_MULTICAST_TTL, but for IPv6 packets. The value -1 is also
accepted, meaning the route default should be used. (added in PHP 5.4) int
between -1 and 255.

Returns the value of the given option, or FALSE on errors.

|socket_set_option| example

<?php >
  $socket = socket_create_listen(1223);
  
  $linger = array('l_linger' => 1, 'l_onoff' => 1);
  socket_set_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, $linger);
  
  var_dump(socket_get_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR));
?>





Version Description 4.3.0 The name of this function was changed. It used to be
called socket_getopt().
