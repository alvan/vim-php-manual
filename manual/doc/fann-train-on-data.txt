fann_train_on_data -- Trains on an entire dataset for a period of time

  bool fann_train_on_data(resource ann, resource data, int max_epochs, int epochs_between_reports, float desired_error)~

Trains on an entire dataset for a period of time.

This training uses the training algorithm chosen by
|fann_set_training_algorithm| and the parameters set for these training
algorithms.

Neural network resource.

Neural network training data resource.

The maximum number of epochs the training should continue

The number of epochs between calling a callback function. A value of zero
means that user function is not called.

The desired |fann_get_MSE| or |fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on the stop
function chosen by |fann_set_train_stop_function|

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
