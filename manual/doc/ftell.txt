ftell -- Returns the current position of the file read/write pointer

  int ftell(resource handle)~

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle}.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |popen|. |ftell| gives undefined results for append-only
streams (opened with "a" flag).

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle} as an integer;
i.e., its offset into the file stream.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

Because PHP"s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers,
some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are
larger than 2GB.

|ftell| example

<?php >
  // opens a file and read some data
  $fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
  $data = fgets($fp, 12);
  
  // where are we ?
  echo ftell($fp); // 11
  
  fclose($fp);
?>
