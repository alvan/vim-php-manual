curl_multi_setopt -- Set an option for the cURL multi handle

  bool curl_multi_setopt(resource mh, int option, mixed value)~



This function is currently not documented; only its argument list is
available.



One of the CURLMOPT_* constants.

The value to be set on {option}.

{value} should be an int for the following values of the {option} parameter:
Option Set {value} to CURLMOPT_PIPELINING Pass 1 to enable or 0 to disable.
Enabling pipelining on a multi handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP
Pipelining as far as possible for transfers using this handle. This means that
if you add a second request that can use an already existing connection, the
second request will be "piped" on the same connection rather than being
executed in parallel. CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS Pass a number that will be used as
the maximum amount of simultaneously open connections that libcurl may cache.
Default is 10. When the cache is full, curl closes the oldest one in the cache
to prevent the number of open connections from increasing.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.
