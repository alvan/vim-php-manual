fann_set_callback -- Sets the callback function for use during training

  bool fann_set_callback(resource ann, collable callback)~

Sets the callback function for use during training. It means that it is called
from |fann_train_on_data| or |fann_train_on_file|.

Neural network resource.

The supplied callback function takes following parameters: ann - The neural
network resource train - The train data resource or NULL if called from
|fann_train_on_file| max_epochs - The maximum number of epochs the training
should continue epochs_between_reports - The number of epochs between calling
this function desired_error - The desired |fann_get_MSE| or
|fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on the stop function chosen by
|fann_set_train_stop_function| epochs - The current epoch

The callback should return TRUE. If it returns FALSE, the training will
terminate.

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
