stream_filter_register -- Register a user defined stream filter

  bool stream_filter_register(string filtername, string classname)~

|stream_filter_register| allows you to implement your own filter on any
registered stream used with all the other filesystem functions (such as
|fopen|, |fread| etc.).

{filtername} The filter name to be registered.

{classname} To implement a filter, you need to define a class as an extension
of php_user_filter with a number of member functions. When performing
read/write operations on the stream to which your filter is attached, PHP will
pass the data through your filter (and any other filters attached to that
stream) so that the data may be modified as desired. You must implement the
methods exactly as described in php_user_filter - doing otherwise will lead to
undefined behaviour.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|stream_filter_register| will return FALSE if the {filtername} is already
defined.

Filter for capitalizing characters on foo-bar.txt stream The example below
implements a filter named strtoupper on the foo-bar.txt stream which will
capitalize all letter characters written to/read from that stream.

<?php >
  /* Define our filter class */
  class strtoupper_filter extends php_user_filter {
    function filter($in, $out, &amp;$consumed, $closing)
    {
      while ($bucket = stream_bucket_make_writeable($in)) {
        $bucket->data = strtoupper($bucket->data);
        $consumed += $bucket->datalen;
        stream_bucket_append($out, $bucket);
      }
      return PSFS_PASS_ON;
    }
  }
  
  /* Register our filter with PHP */
  stream_filter_register("strtoupper", "strtoupper_filter")
      or die("Failed to register filter");
  
  $fp = fopen("foo-bar.txt", "w");
  
  /* Attach the registered filter to the stream just opened */
  stream_filter_append($fp, "strtoupper");
  
  fwrite($fp, "Line1\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Word - 2\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Easy As 123\n");
  
  fclose($fp);
  
  /* Read the contents back out
   */
  readfile("foo-bar.txt");
?>

The above example will output:

  LINE1
  WORD - 2
  EASY AS 123



Registering a generic filter class to match multiple filter names.

<?php >
  /* Define our filter class */
  class string_filter extends php_user_filter {
    var $mode;
  
    function filter($in, $out, &amp;$consumed, $closing)
    {
      while ($bucket = stream_bucket_make_writeable($in)) {
        if ($this->mode == 1) {
          $bucket->data = strtoupper($bucket->data);
        } elseif ($this->mode == 0) {
          $bucket->data = strtolower($bucket->data);
        }
  
        $consumed += $bucket->datalen;
        stream_bucket_append($out, $bucket);
      }
      return PSFS_PASS_ON;
    }
  
    function onCreate()
    {
      if ($this->filtername == 'str.toupper') {
        $this->mode = 1;
      } elseif ($this->filtername == 'str.tolower') {
        $this->mode = 0;
      } else {
        /* Some other str.* filter was asked for,
           report failure so that PHP will keep looking */
        return false;
      }
  
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  /* Register our filter with PHP */
  stream_filter_register("str.*", "string_filter")
      or die("Failed to register filter");
  
  $fp = fopen("foo-bar.txt", "w");
  
  /* Attach the registered filter to the stream just opened
     We could alternately bind to str.tolower here */
  stream_filter_append($fp, "str.toupper");
  
  fwrite($fp, "Line1\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Word - 2\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Easy As 123\n");
  
  fclose($fp);
  
  /* Read the contents back out
   */
  readfile("foo-bar.txt");
?>

The above example will output:

  LINE1
  WORD - 2
  EASY AS 123
