htmlentities -- Convert all applicable characters to HTML entities

  string htmlentities(string string [, int flags [, string encoding [, bool double_encode]]])~

This function is identical to |htmlspecialchars| in all ways, except with
|htmlentities|, all characters which have HTML character entity equivalents
are translated into these entities.

If you want to decode instead (the reverse) you can use |html_entity_decode|.

{string} The input string.

{flags} A bitmask of one or more of the following flags, which specify how to
handle quotes, invalid code unit sequences and the used document type. The
default is ENT_COMPAT | ENT_HTML401. Available {flags} constants Constant Name
Description ENT_COMPAT Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes
alone. ENT_QUOTES Will convert both double and single quotes. ENT_NOQUOTES
Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted. ENT_IGNORE Silently
discard invalid code unit sequences instead of returning an empty string.
Using this flag is discouraged as it may have security implications.
ENT_SUBSTITUTE Replace invalid code unit sequences with a Unicode Replacement
Character U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#FFFD; (otherwise) instead of returning an empty
string. ENT_DISALLOWED Replace invalid code points for the given document type
with a Unicode Replacement Character U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#FFFD; (otherwise)
instead of leaving them as is. This may be useful, for instance, to ensure the
well-formedness of XML documents with embedded external content. ENT_HTML401
Handle code as HTML 4.01. ENT_XML1 Handle code as XML 1. ENT_XHTML Handle code
as XHTML. ENT_HTML5 Handle code as HTML 5.

{encoding} Like |htmlspecialchars|, |htmlentities| takes an optional third
argument {encoding} which defines encoding used in conversion. If omitted, the
default value for this argument is ISO-8859-1 in versions of PHP prior to
5.4.0, and UTF-8 from PHP 5.4.0 onwards. Although this argument is technically
optional, you are highly encouraged to specify the correct value for your
code.

&reference.strings.charsets; {double_encode} When {double_encode} is turned
off PHP will not encode existing html entities. The default is to convert
everything.

Returns the encoded string.

If the input {string} contains an invalid code unit sequence within the given
{encoding} an empty string will be returned, unless either the ENT_IGNORE or
ENT_SUBSTITUTE flags are set.

Version Description 5.4.0 The default value for the {encoding} parameter was
changed to UTF-8. 5.4.0 The constants ENT_SUBSTITUTE, ENT_DISALLOWED,
ENT_HTML401, ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML and ENT_HTML5 were added. 5.3.0 The constant
ENT_IGNORE was added. 5.2.3 The {double_encode} parameter was added. 4.1.0 The
{encoding} parameter was added. 4.0.3 The {flags} parameter was added.

A |htmlentities| example

<?php >
  $str = "A 'quote' is <b>bold</b>";
  
  // Outputs: A 'quote' is <b>bold</b>
  echo htmlentities($str);
  
  // Outputs: A &amp;#039;quote&amp;#039; is <b>bold</b>
  echo htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES);
?>





Usage of ENT_IGNORE

<?php >
  $str = "\x8F!!!";
  
  // Outputs an empty string
  echo htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8");
  
  // Outputs "!!!"
  echo htmlentities($str, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_IGNORE, "UTF-8");
?>
