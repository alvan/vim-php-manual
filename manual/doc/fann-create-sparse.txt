fann_create_sparse -- Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which
is not fully connected

  ReturnType fann_create_sparse(float connection_rate, int num_layers, int num_neurons1, int num_neurons2 [, int ...])~

Creates a standard backpropagation neural network, which is not fully
connected.

The connection rate controls how many connections there will be in the
network. If the connection rate is set to 1, the network will be fully
connected, but if it is set to 0.5 only half of the connections will be set. A
connection rate of 1 will yield the same result as |fann_create_standard|.

The total number of layers including the input and the output layer.

Number of neurons in the first layer.

Number of neurons in the second layer.

Number of neurons in other layers.

Returns a neural network resource on success, or FALSE on error.
