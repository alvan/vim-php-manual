fann_save -- Saves the entire network to a configuration file

  bool fann_save(resource ann, string configuration_file)~

Saves the entire network to a configuration file.

The configuration file contains all information about the neural network and
enables |fann_create_from_file| to create an exact copy of the neural network
and all of the parameters associated with the neural network.

These three parameters (|fann_set_callback|, |fann_set_error_log|,
|fann_set_user_data|) are NOT saved to the file because they cannot safely be
ported to a different location. Also temporary parameters generated during
training like |fann_get_MSE| is not saved.

Neural network resource.

The configuration file path.

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
