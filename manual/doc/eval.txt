eval -- Evaluate a string as PHP code

  mixed eval(string code)~

Evaluates the given {code} as PHP.

The |eval| language construct is very dangerous because it allows execution of
arbitrary PHP code. Its use thus is discouraged. If you have carefully
verified that there is no other option than to use this construct, pay special
attention not to pass any user provided data into it without properly
validating it beforehand.

{code} Valid PHP code to be evaluated.
