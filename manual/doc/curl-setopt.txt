                                     Note:

                                     Your best bet is to not set
                                     this and let it use the
                                     default. Setting it to 2 or 3
                                     is very dangerous given the
                                     known vulnerabilities in SSLv2
                                     and SSLv3.

                                 Use {CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE} to
                                 return the page only if it has been
                                 modified since the time specified
                                 in CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE. If it hasn't
    CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION        been modified, a "304 Not Modified"
                                 header will be returned assuming
                                 CURLOPT_HEADER is TRUE. Use

                                 {CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE} is the
                                 default.

                                    The contents of the "Cookie: "
                                    header to be used in the HTTP
    CURLOPT_COOKIE                  request. Note that multiple
                                    cookies are separated with a
                                    semicolon followed by a space
                                    (e.g., "fruit=apple; colour=red")
                                    The name of the file containing
                                    the cookie data. The cookie file
                                    can be in Netscape format, or

                                    A custom request method to use
                                    instead of "GET" or "HEAD" when
                                    doing a HTTP request. This is
                                    useful for doing "DELETE" or
                                    other, more obscure HTTP
                                    requests. Valid values are things
                                    like "GET", "POST", "CONNECT" and
                                    so on; i.e. Do not enter a whole
                                    HTTP request line here. For
    CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST           instance, entering "GET /
                                    index.html HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"
                                    would be incorrect.

                                        Don't do this without making

                                    is used. Setting this option to

                             the cURL resource, the second is a string with
    CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION   the header data to be written. The header data
                             must be written by this callback. Return the

                             transfer, the third is the number of bytes
                             downloaded so far, the fourth is the total number
                             of bytes expected to be uploaded in this
                             transfer, and the fifth is the number of bytes
                             uploaded so far.

                                 The callback is only called when the
                                 CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS option is set to FALSE.

                             Return a non-zero value to abort the transfer. In
                             which case, the transfer will set a
                             CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK error.

                             A callback accepting three parameters. The first
                             is the cURL resource, the second is a stream
                             resource provided to cURL through the option
                             CURLOPT_INFILE, and the third is the maximum
    CURLOPT_READFUNCTION     amount of data to be read. The callback must
                             return a string with a length equal or smaller
                             than the amount of data requested, typically by
                             reading it from the passed stream resource. It
                             should return an empty string to signal EOF.
                             A callback accepting two parameters. The first is
                             the cURL resource, and the second is a string
    CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION    with the data to be written. The data must be
                             saved by this callback. It must return the exact
                             number of bytes written or the transfer will be
                             aborted with an error.

        CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES.

==============================================================================
*Examples*

Example #1 Initializing a new cURL session and fetching a web page

<?php >
    // create a new cURL resource
    $ch = curl_init();

    // set URL and other appropriate options
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.example.com/");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);

    // grab URL and pass it to the browser
    curl_exec($ch);

    // close cURL resource, and free up system resources
    curl_close($ch);
<?>

Example #2 Uploading file

<?php >

    /* http://localhost/upload.php:
    print_r($_POST);
    print_r($_FILES);
    */

    $ch = curl_init();

    $data = array('name' => 'Foo', 'file' => '@/home/user/test.png');

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://localhost/upload.php');
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);

    curl_exec($ch);
<?>

The above example will output:

Array
(
    [name] => Foo
)
Array
(
    [file] => Array
        (
            [name] => test.png
            [type] => image/png
            [tmp_name] => /tmp/phpcpjNeQ
            [error] => 0
            [size] => 279
        )

)


==============================================================================
*Notes*

    Note:

    Passing an array to CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS will encode the data as multipart/
    form-data, while passing a URL-encoded string will encode the data as
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
