fann_init_weights -- Initialize the weights using Widrow + Nguyen’s
algorithm

  bool fann_init_weights(resource ann, resource train_data)~

Initialize the weights using Widrow + Nguyen’s algorithm.

This function behaves similarly to |fann_randomize_weights|. It will use the
algorithm developed by Derrick Nguyen and Bernard Widrow to set the weights in
such a way as to speed up training. This technique is not always successful,
and in some cases can be less efficient than a purely random initialization.

The algorithm requires access to the range of the input data (for example
largest and smallest input), and therefore accepts a second argument, data,
which is the training data that will be used to train the network.

Neural network resource.

Neural network training data resource.

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
