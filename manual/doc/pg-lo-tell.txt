|pg_lo_tell| example

<?php >
     $doc_oid = 189762345;
     $database = pg_connect("dbname=jacarta");
     pg_query($database, "begin");
     $handle = pg_lo_open($database, $doc_oid, "r");
     // Skip first 50000 bytes
     pg_lo_seek($handle, 50000, PGSQL_SEEK_SET);
     // See how far we've skipped
     $offset = pg_lo_tell($handle);
     echo "Seek position is: $offset";
     pg_query($database, "commit");
?>

The above example will output:

  Seek position is: 50000
