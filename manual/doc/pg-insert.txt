pg_insert -- Insert array into table

  mixed pg_insert(resource connection, string table_name, array assoc_array [, int options = PGSQL_DML_EXEC])~

|pg_insert| inserts the values of {assoc_array} into the table specified by
{table_name}. If {options} is specified, |pg_convert| is applied to
{assoc_array} with the specified options.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource.

{table_name} Name of the table into which to insert rows. The table
{table_name} must at least have as many columns as {assoc_array} has elements.

{assoc_array} An array whose keys are field names in the table {table_name},
and whose values are the values of those fields that are to be inserted.

{options} Any number of PGSQL_CONV_OPTS, PGSQL_DML_NO_CONV, PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE,
PGSQL_DML_EXEC, PGSQL_DML_ASYNC or PGSQL_DML_STRING combined. If
PGSQL_DML_STRING is part of the {options} then query string is returned. When
PGSQL_DML_NO_CONV or PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE is set, it does not call |pg_convert|
internally.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure. Returns string if
PGSQL_DML_STRING is passed via {options}.

|pg_insert| example

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect('dbname=foo');
    // This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically
    $res = pg_insert($dbconn, 'post_log', $_POST);
    if ($res) {
        echo "POST data is successfully logged\n";
    } else {
        echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";
    }
?>





Version Description 5.6.0 No longer experimental. Added PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE
constant, TRUE/FALSE and NULL data type support. 5.5.3/5.4.19 Direct SQL
injection to {table_name} and Indirect SQL injection to identifiers are fixed.
