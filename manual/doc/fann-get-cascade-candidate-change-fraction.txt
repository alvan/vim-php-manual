fann_get_cascade_candidate_change_fraction -- Returns the cascade candidate
change fraction

  float fann_get_cascade_candidate_change_fraction(resource ann)~

The cascade candidate change fraction is a number between 0 and 1 determining
how large a fraction the |fann_get_MSE| value should change within
|fann_get_cascade_candidate_stagnation_epochs| during training of the
candidate neurons, in order for the training not to stagnate. If the training
stagnates, the training of the candidate neurons will be ended and the best
candidate will be selected.

It means that if the MSE does not change by a fraction of
|fann_get_cascade_candidate_change_fraction| during a period of
|fann_get_cascade_candidate_stagnation_epochs|, the training of the candidate
neurons is stopped because the training has stagnated.

If the cascade candidate change fraction is low, the candidate neurons will be
trained more and if the fraction is high they will be trained less.

The default cascade candidate change fraction is 0.01, which is equalent to a
1% change in MSE.
