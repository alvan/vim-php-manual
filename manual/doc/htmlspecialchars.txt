htmlspecialchars -- Convert special characters to HTML entities

  string htmlspecialchars(string string [, int flags = ENT_COMPAT | ENT_HTML401 [, string encoding = "UTF-8" [, bool double_encode = true]]])~

Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be
represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This
function returns a string with these conversions made. If you require all
input substrings that have associated named entities to be translated, use
|htmlentities| instead.

If the input string passed to this function and the final document share the
same character set, this function is sufficient to prepare input for inclusion
in most contexts of an HTML document. If, however, the input can represent
characters that are not coded in the final document character set and you wish
to retain those characters (as numeric or named entities), both this function
and |htmlentities| (which only encodes substrings that have named entity
equivalents) may be insufficient. You may have to use
|mb_encode_numericentity| instead.
