mysql_real_escape_string -- Escapes special characters in a string for use in
an SQL statement

This extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, and will be removed in the
future. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also
MySQL: choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information.
Alternatives to this function include:

  string mysql_real_escape_string(string unescaped_string [, resource link_identifier = NULL])~

Escapes special characters in the {unescaped_string}, taking into account the
current character set of the connection so that it is safe to place it in a
|mysql_query|. If binary data is to be inserted, this function must be used.

|mysql_real_escape_string| calls MySQL's library function
mysql_real_escape_string, which prepends backslashes to the following
characters: \x00, \n, \r, \, ', " and \x1a.

This function must always (with few exceptions) be used to make data safe
before sending a query to MySQL.

The character set must be set either at the server level, or with the API
function |mysql_set_charset| for it to affect |mysql_real_escape_string|. See
the concepts section on character sets for more information.

{unescaped_string} The string that is to be escaped.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns the escaped string, or FALSE on error.

Simple |mysql_real_escape_string| example

<?php >
  // Connect
  $link = mysql_connect('mysql_host', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password')
      OR die(mysql_error());
  
  // Query
  $query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='%s' AND password='%s'",
              mysql_real_escape_string($user),
              mysql_real_escape_string($password));
?>





An example SQL Injection Attack

<?php >
  // We didn't check $_POST['password'], it could be anything the user wanted! For example:
  $_POST['username'] = 'aidan';
  $_POST['password'] = "' OR ''='";
  
  // Query database to check if there are any matching users
  $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='{$_POST['username']}' AND password='{$_POST['password']}'";
  mysql_query($query);
  
  // This means the query sent to MySQL would be:
  echo $query;
?>

The query sent to MySQL:

  SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='aidan' AND password='' OR ''=''

This would allow anyone to log in without a valid password.





A MySQL connection is required before using |mysql_real_escape_string|
otherwise an error of level E_WARNING is generated, and FALSE is returned. If
{link_identifier} isn't defined, the last MySQL connection is used.

If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, first apply |stripslashes| to the data. Using
this function on data which has already been escaped will escape the data
twice.

If this function is not used to escape data, the query is vulnerable to SQL
Injection Attacks.

|mysql_real_escape_string| does not escape % and _. These are wildcards in
MySQL if combined with LIKE, GRANT, or REVOKE.
