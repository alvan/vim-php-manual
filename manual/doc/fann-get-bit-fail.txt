fann_get_bit_fail -- The number of fail bits

  int fann_get_bit_fail(resource ann)~

The number of fail bits; means the number of output neurons which differ more
than the bit fail limit (see |fann_get_bit_fail_limit|,
|fann_set_bit_fail_limit|). The bits are counted in all of the training data,
so this number can be higher than the number of training data.

This value is reset by |fann_reset_MSE| and updated by all the same functions
which also updates the MSE value (e.g. |fann_test_data|, |fann_train_epoch|)

Neural network resource.

The number of bits fail, or FALSE on error.
