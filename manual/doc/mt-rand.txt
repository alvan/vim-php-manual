mt_rand -- Generate a better random value

  int mt_rand()~

  int mt_rand(int min, int max)~

Many random number generators of older libcs have dubious or unknown
characteristics and are slow. By default, PHP uses the libc random number
generator with the |rand| function. The |mt_rand| function is a drop-in
replacement for this. It uses a random number generator with known
characteristics using the Mersenne Twister, which will produce random numbers
four times faster than what the average libc rand() provides.

If called without the optional {min}, {max} arguments |mt_rand| returns a
pseudo-random value between 0 and |mt_getrandmax|. If you want a random number
between 5 and 15 (inclusive), for example, use mt_rand(5, 15).

{min} Optional lowest value to be returned (default: 0)

{max} Optional highest value to be returned (default: |mt_getrandmax|)

A random integer value between {min} (or 0) and {max} (or |mt_getrandmax|,
inclusive), or FALSE if {max} is less than {min}.
