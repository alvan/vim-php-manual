html_entity_decode -- Convert all HTML entities to their applicable characters

  string html_entity_decode(string string [, int flags = ENT_COMPAT | ENT_HTML401 [, string encoding = "UTF-8"]])~

|html_entity_decode| is the opposite of |htmlentities| in that it converts all
HTML entities in the {string} to their applicable characters.

More precisely, this function decodes all the entities (including all numeric
entities) that a) are necessarily valid for the chosen document type — i.e.,
for XML, this function does not decode named entities that might be defined in
some DTD — and b) whose character or characters are in the coded character
set associated with the chosen encoding and are permitted in the chosen
document type. All other entities are left as is.

{string} The input string.

{flags} A bitmask of one or more of the following flags, which specify how to
handle quotes and which document type to use. The default is ENT_COMPAT |
ENT_HTML401. Available {flags} constants Constant Name Description ENT_COMPAT
Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes alone. ENT_QUOTES Will
convert both double and single quotes. ENT_NOQUOTES Will leave both double and
single quotes unconverted. ENT_HTML401 Handle code as HTML 4.01. ENT_XML1
Handle code as XML 1. ENT_XHTML Handle code as XHTML. ENT_HTML5 Handle code as
HTML 5.

{encoding} Encoding to use. If omitted, the default value for this argument is
ISO-8859-1 in versions of PHP prior to 5.4.0, and UTF-8 from PHP 5.4.0
onwards.

&reference.strings.charsets;

Returns the decoded string.

Version Description 5.4.0 Default encoding changed from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.
5.4.0 The constants ENT_HTML401, ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML and ENT_HTML5 were added.
5.0.0 Support for multi-byte encodings was added.

Decoding HTML entities

<?php >
  $orig = "I'll \"walk\" the <b>dog</b> now";
  
  $a = htmlentities($orig);
  
  $b = html_entity_decode($a);
  
  echo $a; // I'll "walk" the <b>dog</b> now
  
  echo $b; // I'll "walk" the <b>dog</b> now
?>





You might wonder why trim(html_entity_decode('&nbsp;')); doesn't reduce the
string to an empty string, that's because the '&nbsp;' entity is not ASCII
code 32 (which is stripped by |trim|) but ASCII code 160 (0xa0) in the default
ISO 8859-1 encoding.
