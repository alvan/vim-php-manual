stripos -- Find the position of the first occurrence of a case-insensitive
substring in a string

  int stripos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset])~

Find the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string.

Unlike the |strpos|, |stripos| is case-insensitive.

{haystack} The string to search in.

{needle} Note that the {needle} may be a string of one or more characters.

If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the
ordinal value of a character.

{offset} If specified, search will start this number of characters counted
from the beginning of the string. Unlike |strrpos| and |strripos|, the offset
cannot be negative.

Returns the position of where the needle exists relative to the beginnning of
the {haystack} string (independent of offset). Also note that string positions
start at 0, and not 1.

Returns FALSE if the needle was not found.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.

|stripos| examples

<?php >
  $findme    = 'a';
  $mystring1 = 'xyz';
  $mystring2 = 'ABC';
  
  $pos1 = stripos($mystring1, $findme);
  $pos2 = stripos($mystring2, $findme);
  
  // Nope, 'a' is certainly not in 'xyz'
  if ($pos1 === false) {
      echo "The string '$findme' was not found in the string '$mystring1'";
  }
  
  // Note our use of ===.  Simply == would not work as expected
  // because the position of 'a' is the 0th (first) character.
  if ($pos2 !== false) {
      echo "We found '$findme' in '$mystring2' at position $pos2";
  }
?>





This function is binary-safe.
