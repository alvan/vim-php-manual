fann_train -- Train one iteration with a set of inputs, and a set of desired
outputs

  bool fann_train(resource ann, array input, array desired_output)~

Train one iteration with a set of inputs, and a set of desired outputs. This
training is always incremental training, since only one pattern is presented.

Neural network resource.

An array of inputs. This array must be exactly |fann_get_num_input| long.

An array of desired outputs. This array must be exactly |fann_get_num_output|
long.

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
