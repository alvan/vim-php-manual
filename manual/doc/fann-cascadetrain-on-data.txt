fann_cascadetrain_on_data -- Trains on an entire dataset, for a period of time
using the Cascade2 training algorithm

  bool fann_cascadetrain_on_data(resource ann, resource data, int max_neurons, int neurons_between_reports, float desired_error)~

The cascade output change fraction is a number between 0 and 1 determining how
large a fraction the |fann_get_MSE| value should change within
|fann_get_cascade_output_stagnation_epochs| during training of the output
connections, in order for the training not to stagnate. If the training
stagnates, the training of the output connections will be ended and new
candidates will be prepared.

This training uses the parameters set using the fann_set_cascade_..., but it
also uses another training algorithm as it’s internal training algorithm.
This algorithm can be set to either FANN_TRAIN_RPROP or FANN_TRAIN_QUICKPROP
by |fann_set_training_algorithm|, and the parameters set for these training
algorithms will also affect the cascade training.

Neural network resource.

Neural network training data resource.

The maximum number of neurons to be added to neural network.

The number of neurons between printing a status report. A value of zero means
no reports should be printed.

The desired |fann_get_MSE| or |fann_get_bit_fail|, depending on which stop
function is chosen by |fann_set_train_stop_function|

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE otherwise.
