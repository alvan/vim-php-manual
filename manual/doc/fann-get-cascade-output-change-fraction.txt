fann_get_cascade_output_change_fraction -- Returns the cascade output change
fraction

  float fann_get_cascade_output_change_fraction(resource ann)~

The cascade output change fraction is a number between 0 and 1 determining how
large a fraction of the |fann_get_MSE| value should change within
|fann_get_cascade_output_stagnation_epochs| during training of the output
connections, in order for the training not to stagnate. If the training
stagnates, the training of the output connections will be ended and new
candidates will be prepared.

It means that if the MSE does not change by a fraction of
|fann_get_cascade_output_change_fraction| during a period of
|fann_get_cascade_output_stagnation_epochs|, the training of the output
connections is stopped because the training has stagnated.

If the cascade output change fraction is low, the output connections will be
trained more and if the fraction is high, they will be trained less.

The default cascade output change fraction is 0.01, which is equalent to a 1%
change in MSE.
