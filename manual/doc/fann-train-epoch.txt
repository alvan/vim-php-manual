fann_train_epoch -- Train one epoch with a set of training data

  float fann_train_epoch(resource ann, resource data)~

Train one epoch with the training data stored in data. One epoch is where all
of the training data is considered exactly once.

This function returns the MSE error as it is calculated either before or
during the actual training. This is not the actual MSE after the training
epoch, but since calculating this will require to go through the entire
training set once more. It is more than adequate to use this value during
training.

The training algorithm used by this function is chosen by
|fann_set_training_algorithm| function.

Neural network resource.

Neural network training data resource.
