mysql_get_server_info -- Get MySQL server info

This extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, and will be removed in the
future. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also
MySQL: choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information.
Alternatives to this function include:

  string mysql_get_server_info([resource link_identifier = NULL])~

Retrieves the MySQL server version.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns the MySQL server version on success or FALSE on failure.

|mysql_get_server_info| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  printf("MySQL server version: %s\n", mysql_get_server_info());
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  MySQL server version: 4.0.1-alpha



|mysql_get_client_info| |mysql_get_host_info| |mysql_get_proto_info|
|phpversion|
