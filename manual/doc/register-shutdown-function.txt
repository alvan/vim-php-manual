register_shutdown_function -- Register a function for execution on shutdown

  void register_shutdown_function(callable callback [, mixed parameter [, mixed ...]])~

Registers a {callback} to be executed after script execution finishes or
|exit| is called.

Multiple calls to |register_shutdown_function| can be made, and each will be
called in the same order as they were registered. If you call |exit| within
one registered shutdown function, processing will stop completely and no other
registered shutdown functions will be called.

{callback} The shutdown callback to register.

The shutdown callbacks are executed as the part of the request, so it's
possible to send output from them and access output buffers.

{parameter} It is possible to pass parameters to the shutdown function by
passing additional parameters.

{...}

No value is returned.

If the passed callback is not callable a E_WARNING level error will be
generated.

Version Description 4.1.0 The shutdown functions are now called as a part of
the request. In earlier versions under Apache, the registered shutdown
functions were called after the request has been completed (including sending
any output buffers), so it was not possible to send output to the browser
using |echo| or |print|, or retrieve the contents of any output buffers using
|ob_get_contents|. Headers were also always already sent.

|register_shutdown_function| example

<?php >
  function shutdown()
  {
      // This is our shutdown function, in 
      // here we can do any last operations
      // before the script is complete.
  
      echo 'Script executed with success', PHP_EOL;
  }
  
  register_shutdown_function('shutdown');
?>





Working directory of the script can change inside the shutdown function under
some web servers, e.g. Apache.

Shutdown functions will not be executed if the process is killed with a
SIGTERM or SIGKILL signal. While you cannot intercept a SIGKILL, you can use
|pcntl_signal| to install a handler for a SIGTERM which uses |exit| to end
cleanly.
