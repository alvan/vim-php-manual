mcrypt_encrypt -- Encrypts plaintext with given parameters

  string mcrypt_encrypt(string cipher, string key, string data, string mode [, string iv])~

Encrypts the data and returns it.

{cipher} One of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants, or the name of the algorithm
as string.

{key} The key with which the data will be encrypted. If it's smaller than the
required keysize, it is padded with '\0'. It is better not to use ASCII
strings for keys.

It is recommended to use the mhash functions to create a key from a string.

{data} The data that will be encrypted with the given {cipher} and {mode}. If
the size of the data is not n * blocksize, the data will be padded with '\0'.

The returned crypttext can be larger than the size of the data that was given
by {data}.

{mode} One of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants, or one of the following
strings: "ecb", "cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream".

{iv} Used for the initialization in CBC, CFB, OFB modes, and in some
algorithms in STREAM mode. If you do not supply an IV, while it is needed for
an algorithm, the function issues a warning and uses an IV with all its bytes
set to "\0".

Returns the encrypted data, as a string.

      # --- ENCRYPTION ---
  
      # the key should be random binary, use scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2 to
      # convert a string into a key
      # key is specified using hexadecimal
      $key = pack('H*', "bcb04b7e103a0cd8b54763051cef08bc55abe029fdebae5e1d417e2ffb2a00a3");
      
      # show key size use either 16, 24 or 32 byte keys for AES-128, 192
      # and 256 respectively
      $key_size =  strlen($key);
      echo "Key size: " . $key_size . "\n";
      
      $plaintext = "This string was AES-256 / CBC / ZeroBytePadding encrypted.";
  
      # create a random IV to use with CBC encoding
      $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
      $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
      
      # creates a cipher text compatible with AES (Rijndael block size = 128)
      # to keep the text confidential 
      # only suitable for encoded input that never ends with value 00h
      # (because of default zero padding)
      $ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key,
                                   $plaintext, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);
  
      # prepend the IV for it to be available for decryption
      $ciphertext = $iv . $ciphertext;
      
      # encode the resulting cipher text so it can be represented by a string
      $ciphertext_base64 = base64_encode($ciphertext);
  
      echo  $ciphertext_base64 . "\n";
  
      # === WARNING ===
  
      # Resulting cipher text has no integrity or authenticity added
      # and is not protected against padding oracle attacks.
      
      # --- DECRYPTION ---
      
      $ciphertext_dec = base64_decode($ciphertext_base64);
      
      # retrieves the IV, iv_size should be created using mcrypt_get_iv_size()
      $iv_dec = substr($ciphertext_dec, 0, $iv_size);
      
      # retrieves the cipher text (everything except the $iv_size in the front)
      $ciphertext_dec = substr($ciphertext_dec, $iv_size);
  
      # may remove 00h valued characters from end of plain text
      $plaintext_dec = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key,
                                      $ciphertext_dec, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv_dec);
      
      echo  $plaintext_dec . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  Key size: 32

  This string was AES-256 / CBC / ZeroBytePadding encrypted.
