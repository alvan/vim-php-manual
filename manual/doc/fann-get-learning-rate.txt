fann_get_learning_rate -- Returns the learning rate

  float fann_get_learning_rate(resource ann)~

The learning rate is used to determine how aggressive training should be for
some of the training algorithms (FANN_TRAIN_INCREMENTAL, FANN_TRAIN_BATCH,
FANN_TRAIN_QUICKPROP). Do however note that it is not used in
FANN_TRAIN_RPROP.

The default learning rate is 0.7.

Neural network resource.

The learning rate, or FALSE on error.
